Just a few notes on the assignment.

I did the first part of the extra credit (movable buffer). The parameter is the third line of the file, which takes the format "ORIG x y z" where x y and z are the coordinates of the origin of the voxel buffer. I've modified the original test files to have origins of (0, 0, 0) in the files. I've also added a fourth test file, "test4.txt", which is exactly the same as "test1.txt" except that the origin is at (-100, -100, 0). This produces a translated image.

All other functionality seems to be fine.
